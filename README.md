# 🛒 Assignment 7 – E-Commerce Web Application

Welcome to **Assignment-7**, my ongoing project to build a full-stack E-Commerce web application.  
This week, I focused on developing a fully functional and visually polished **frontend** using **React.js**. ✨

## ✅ What I’ve Accomplished This Week

In this phase, I have:

- 🎨 Designed and built a clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI
- 🌐 Created **4 core pages**:
  - 🏠 **Home Page** – Highlights products with attractive visuals and layout
  - 🛍 **Product Page** – Displays products dynamically with proper UI elements
  - 📞 **Contact Page** – Includes a styled form to capture user queries
  - ℹ️ **About Page** – Gives an overview of the platform
- ⚙️ Integrated data fetching from a **locally simulated database** to render product listings dynamically
- 💅 Used modern CSS and layout techniques to ensure consistency across pages

## 🧠 Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Local Data**: JSON-based dummy data (simulating real-world product data)
- **Design Tools**: Responsive Flexbox/Grid, CSS modules

## 🔮 What’s Coming Next (Next Week)

- 🚀 I will begin working on the **backend** part using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- 🧠 Setup real-time database connectivity and RESTful APIs
- 🔐 Implement authentication, user sessions, and secure data handling
- 🛍️ Enable add-to-cart, checkout, and order management features
